Take a snapshot and download to device or upload to cloudinary.  You need a [cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) and [cloudinary preset](https://support.cloudinary.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004967272-Upload-Preset-Configuration) to upload to your own account.

## How the HTML 5 Camera Works
1. When page loads the camera is on (left side of desktop and top of mobile)
2. You can take a **snapshot** (it will appear on the right if desktop or under the camera if mobile)
3. You can select which camera if more than one available such as on a mobile
4. You can **stop** and **start** the camera
5. You can **upload** to my personal space on Cloudinary and you'll see photos in a gallery at the bottom of the page
6. You can **download** to your device's hard drive
7. You will be access to allow the camera device to operate on the web page the first time you load the page
